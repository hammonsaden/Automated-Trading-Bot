# Automater-Trading-Bot


This is my second program I've built for my resume, its a "Automated" Trading Bot built using Python, SQL, and a API called "Finnhub" for all stock data.

The bot will make auto trades for you throughout the day as long as the program is running in the background using live price data, this program was built assuming 0% trade fees.

~ Features ~
You can log in to the program via the home login page (default account login is, username = "user1", password = "pswd")
You can view the amount of money your investing portfolio is currently worth (Fake Money, of course!).
You can view data for any stock using the search bar at the top of the screen (current stock price, high price of the day, low price of the day, previous close price.)
You can add stocks to your watch list for quick searching.
You can view previous trades made by the bot automatically.
